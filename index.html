        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>I was born and raised in Southern Germany. After graduating highschool, I studied International Business in Maastricht, Netherlands. During that time, I was able to study abroad for one semester at the University of California, Irvine. During that time, I discovered my love for Southern California. After my Bachelor's degree, I went on to complete a Master's degree in Management in Mannheim, Germany. I majored in Information Systems and parallel to my studies, I worked at SAP in a product management position. Through that job, I worked hand in hand with a team of developers, and discovered my passion for software and web development.</p>
